# Sentimental Analysis

## Project Description

This "Sentimental Analysis" project explores customer reviews of AirPods to identify and interpret underlying emotions. Using natural language processing and various classification models, the project categorizes sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral. The insights gained from this analysis aim to enhance product quality and customer satisfaction by understanding customer feedback more effectively.
